WARNING: FusionInventory Agent would better be installed as systemd service and
this is the recommanded way of doing.

But if you prefer to run FusionInventory Agent as scheduled cron job, you may need
to do the following as root:
1. stop and disable the systemd service (if start/enabled):
   systemctl stop fusioninventory-agent
   systemctl disable fusioninventory-agent

2. create a /etc/fusioninventory/conf.d/better-for-cron.cfg file with the following
   lines:
   # Don't force agent to run inventory at each run, but only
   # after server defined timeout has been reached
   lazy = 1

3. as example, add a root cron job like this:
   # Don't remove --wait option (delay in seconds) so the agent wait a random
   # time before really run its work
   00 */4 * * * /usr/bin/fusioninventory-agent --wait=1800 >/var/lib/fusioninventory-agent/cron.log 2>&1

Be aware, if you don't enable lazy option, you can flood your GLPI server at the
scheduled time, even more if you set the same cron time on many computers and forget
to use --wait option. To avoid such missconfiguration, you would prefer leave the agent
started as systemd service and define a peaceful delay on server. You may adjust
scheduled time and wait command line only option to your needs.

As another argument to not use cron scheduling, this mode finally disables the
httpd daemon listening feature permitting server to manually trigger an inventory
from the server.
