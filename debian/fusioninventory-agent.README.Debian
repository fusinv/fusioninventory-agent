Debian packaging only supports systemd service installation, and follows README.packaging
recommendations.

===

The only installed crontab is now a weekly crontab intended to force system IDS
file updates (pci.ids and usb.ids, provided by hwdata package). By default, no
update is performed and if your system is always up-to-date, you don't need to
enable this feature. Also these databases are intended to keep updated manufacturer
informations for detected harware components, and so, don't enable it if you don't
feel concerned.

Then if you definitively need to force system IDS databases, you need to create
the /etc/default/fusioninventory-agent file with just the following line:
UPDATE_IDS=yes
